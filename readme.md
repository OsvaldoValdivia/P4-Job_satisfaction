#### Multivariable analysis

This series of graphs compares multiple countries using two-axis graphs. Each graph displays two different indicators, showing potential relationships between them. A Pearson correlation test has been conducted to quantify these relationships. This visual and statistical analysis helps uncover connections and trends in job conditions and satisfaction across countries.

## Datasets

The list of indicators extracted from Eurostat consists of data for job conditions and satisfaction-related variables from 33 European countries in the year 2018. These indicators are presented in a tabular format where each row represents a specific country, and each column represents a distinct job condition or satisfaction-related variable. The table offers valuable insights into the working conditions, job satisfaction, and well-being of individuals across Europe.

The data may include a wide range of indicators, such as average working hours, income levels, employment rates, job satisfaction ratings, the prevalence of long working hours, gender pay gap, evening work, and other relevant factors.
